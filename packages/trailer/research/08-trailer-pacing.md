## 1. Optimal Trailer Lengths by Platform

Different contexts demand radically different lengths. One master cut, multiple exports.

| Platform / Context | Ideal Length | Key Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| **YouTube** (full trailer) | 90–120 sec | Hook in first 5–10 sec; mid-roll rise at ~0:40 |
| **YouTube** (teaser) | 15–30 sec | Mystery over explanation |
| **Steam / Epic / PSN / Xbox** | 60–120 sec | Gameplay focus; no long intros |
| **Twitter / X** | 15–45 sec | Autoplay muted; subtitles essential |
| **TikTok** | 15–30 sec (organic), up to 60 sec | 9:16 vertical; hook in first 1–2 sec; messy > polished |
| **Instagram Reels** | 15–60 sec | Square or vertical; fast hook |
| **Announce / Reveal Trailer** | 60–90 sec | Can go up to 2 min if story-driven |
| **Launch Trailer** | 60–150 sec | Blend gameplay + cinematic + accolades |
| **Gameplay Deep-Dive** | 2–3 min | OK to be longer if mechanics are complex |
| **TV Spot / Ad** | 15–30 sec | 1 idea, 1 tone, 1 memorable line |

### Key Rules by Platform

**YouTube:**
- Viewers expect full story arc
- Get to the point in first 5–7 seconds (visual hook, not logo)
- ~90 seconds is the sweet spot for indie games
- Only go over 90 sec if you truly know what you're doing (Derek Lieu)
- Use thumbnail + strong title to get the click

**TikTok:**
- Hook in the first **1–2 seconds** or viewers swipe away
- Don't post polished trailers — they feel corporate and out of place
- Get to the point faster than you think is necessary
- "Here's [cool thing in your game]" is better than a cinematic reveal
- Vertical (9:16) video format — reformatting landscape kills impact
- Caption everything (many watch muted)
- Post consistently; single clips about individual features > full trailers
- Messy/authentic > polished/produced

**Twitter / X:**
- Organic discovery is low (people follow you or they don't)
- Short clips for engagement bait; longer cuts link out
- Subtitles essential (autoplay muted)
- GIFs and short clips get more engagement than full trailers

**Steam Store Page:**
- First few seconds loop as a thumbnail — make them count
- Show gameplay fast; no long cinematics
- 1–2 minutes; must answer "what do I do in this game?"

## 2. Scene Duration Rules

### The Core Principle

**"Good pacing is having a variety of sections which aren't too long or short, and within those sections a variety of shots which also aren't too long or short."** — Derek Lieu

Pacing is not speed. It's knowing when to move on. When the audience starts thinking _"okay I get it"_ — that's when you cut.

### Section Durations (Full 90-sec Trailer)

| Structural Section | Typical Duration | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cold Open / Hook | 3–6 sec | Sudden; mostly visual; establish tone immediately |
| Introduction | 10–15 sec | What is this game? Core loop or world |
| Escalation Phase 1 | 10–15 sec | Mechanics deepen; stakes introduced |
| Escalation Phase 2 | 10–15 sec | New complexity; title cards help divide |
| Climax / Peak Action | 15–25 sec | Fast cuts, boss battles, biggest moments |
| Breath / Cooldown | 3–6 sec | Contrast beat after climax; don't skip this |
| Final Twist / Button | 3–8 sec | Optional; something surprising/emotional |
| End Slate / CTA | 3–5 sec | Game title + wishlist/buy CTA |

### Real-World Example (Spiritfarer Launch Trailer, 2.5 min)

Derek Lieu's breakdown of section durations (in seconds):

```
6 → 14 → 5 → 14 → 15 → 5 → 16 → 6 → 60
```

- Each section covers exactly one idea/theme
- No single section overstays its welcome until the emotional climax (60 sec)
- The long final section is **earned** by the journey

### Individual Shot Durations

- **Early intro shots:** 3–5 seconds per shot (give viewer time to absorb)
- **Mid-trailer shots:** 1.5–3 seconds per shot
- **Climax/montage shots:** 0.5–1.5 seconds per shot
- **Title cards:** 1.5–3 seconds depending on text length (see Typography section)
- **Never more than 3 similar shots in a row** — use rule of threes; third shot should transition or differ

### The "Overstaying Welcome" Test

Ask yourself: *"Would the audience already know this if I cut here?"* If yes — cut.

Sections that overstay their welcome:
- More than 15–20 sec showing the same type of content (boss fights, building, etc.)
- More than 3 consecutive shots of the same mechanic/environment
- Any section where the viewer could predict the next 3 shots

## 3. The Hook–Escalate–Climax–CTA Structure

This is the universal architecture for hype trailers. Every major game trailer maps to it.

### Full Structure (Derek Lieu / Picotion)

```
COLD OPEN (Hook)
  └─ Sudden, mostly visual
  └─ No logos; no title; just game
  └─ Establish tone and genre in 3–6 sec

INTRODUCTION
  └─ What is the game? Who is the protagonist?
  └─ Show the basic mechanic / core loop
  └─ Plant a want or need (story or mechanical)

ESCALATION
  └─ Things get more complicated
  └─ Show depth: abilities, enemies, environments
  └─ Introduce obstacles and stakes
  └─ "What could go wrong?" moments

CLIMAX
  └─ Most exciting point in the trailer
  └─ Fast montage of best moments
  └─ Variety of environments / bosses / abilities
  └─ Music peaks here

BREATH (optional but powerful)
  └─ 3–6 second cooldown after climax
  └─ Let the emotion land
  └─ Contrast = emotional resonance

BUTTON / FINAL TWIST (optional)
  └─ One final "WHOA" or emotional gut-punch
  └─ Something that recontextualizes the whole trailer
  └─ Or a joke that leaves them delighted

END SLATE + CTA
  └─ Game title (large)
  └─ Call to action (WISHLIST ON STEAM / AVAILABLE NOW)
  └─ Platform logos
  └─ Dev/publisher logos (small, bottom)
  └─ Release date or "Coming Soon"
```

### Narrative-Driven Adaptation

If your game has story (like Ika Tensei's isekia/seal narrative):

| Section | Narrative Job |
|---|---|
| Cold Open | Self-contained moment: character or world moment that's intriguing without context |
| Introduction | The protagonist's situation; what they want/need |
| Escalation | The problems they face; obstacles mounting |
| Climax | Stakes of failure; suspense peak; "everything is on the line" |
| Button | Twist that makes you go "...wait, what?" |

### Mechanics-Driven Adaptation

If your game is mechanics-first (DeFi, trading, on-chain gameplay):

| Section | Mechanics Job |
|---|---|
| Cold Open | A striking gameplay moment that hooks (don't explain it yet) |
| Introduction | Show the basic player verb / action loop |
| Escalation | Show how mechanics deepen; what tests the player |
| Climax | Scale / scope / variety / endgame content |
| Button | The mind-blowing mechanic that nothing else does |

### Mini-Arc for Short Formats (30–60 sec)

```
0:00–0:03  → Micro-hook (pattern disruption)
0:03–0:15  → Core premise established
0:15–0:35  → Quick escalation montage
0:35–0:50  → Emotional/visual peak
0:50–0:60  → CTA / title
```

## 4. Cuts Per Minute (CPM) for Hype Trailers

CPM is the clearest metric for trailer energy level. More cuts = more energy, but only up to a point.

### CPM Reference Table

| Mood / Section | Cuts Per Minute | Seconds Per Shot |
|---|---|---|
| Atmospheric intro (slow burn) | 10–20 CPM | 3–6 sec |
| Steady story/world-building | 20–30 CPM | 2–3 sec |
| Rising action | 30–60 CPM | 1–2 sec |
| Hype montage (climax) | 60–90 CPM | 0.7–1 sec |
| Maximum chaos (peak hype) | 90–120 CPM | 0.5–0.7 sec |
| Breath/emotional beat | 5–10 CPM | 6–12 sec |

### How CPM Maps to a Trailer Arc

```
Intro:    ████░░░░░░ (15–20 CPM)
Build:    ██████░░░░ (25–35 CPM)
Escalate: ████████░░ (45–60 CPM)
Climax:   ██████████ (80–120 CPM)
Breath:   ██░░░░░░░░ (5–10 CPM)
End:      ████░░░░░░ (static / very slow)
```

### Practical Rules

1. **Don't max out early** — if you go 120 CPM at 0:20, you have nowhere to go by 1:00
2. **Contrast drives energy** — a 10-CPM breath section makes the subsequent 90-CPM montage hit 3x harder
3. **Music at 120 BPM** = 2 beats/second. Cutting every beat = 120 CPM = can feel robotic
4. **120 BPM rule:** Cut to *key* beats, not *every* beat. Every other downbeat is often the sweet spot
5. **Sub-hit impacts:** Use bass/drum hits to justify hard cuts; use softer beats for dissolves

## 5. Beat Sync Editing Technique

Beat sync is the art of aligning visual cuts and motion to the music's rhythmic structure. Done well it feels inevitable. Done badly it feels mechanical.

### The Fundamentals

**Step 1: Choose music first.** Lock your music track before editing anything. The music IS the skeleton; everything hangs off it.

**Step 2: Mark your key moments:**
```
- Major downbeats (every 4 or 8 bars)
- Bass hits / kick drum accents
- Musical transitions (verse → chorus, etc.)
- The "drop" or climax moment
- The musical outro / decay
```

**Step 3: Build structural beats, then fill between them**
- Lock title cards and major scene transitions to musical peaks
- Fill the space between peaks with shots that move naturally
- Let some shots "float" between beats — this prevents mechanical feeling

### Beat Sync Levels

| Sync Level | Technique | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Loose sync** | Major transitions on key beats; shots float | Emotional / narrative sections |
| **Medium sync** | Cuts on every 2nd–4th beat | Rising action |
| **Tight sync** | Cuts on every beat or half-beat | Climax montage |
| **Sound design sync** | Individual SFX placed on exact frames | Impact moments, reveals |

### Advanced Techniques

**BPM Math:** At 120 BPM = 2 beats/sec = each beat is 0.5 sec. At 90 BPM = 1.5 beats/sec = each beat is ~0.67 sec.
- Know your BPM so you can predict cut points mathematically
- Most DAWs/NLEs show beat markers; use them

**Risers and Transitions:**
- Place 4–8 bar risers before major scene transitions
- Use white flashes, black frames, or whoosh SFX exactly on the "1" beat of a new section
- Sub-bass hits (808-style) land hardest when paired with a wide-to-close shot punch

**Silence as a weapon:**
- Drop the music 1–2 seconds before a major title card reveal
- Let a single sound effect (chain drop, water drip, thunder crack) breathe in silence
- Return to music louder than before — contrast doubles the impact

**The musical arc should match the visual arc:**
- Intro music = sparse, mysterious
- Build music = percussive, urgency growing  
- Climax music = full orchestration, maximum velocity
- Outro = resolution or haunting fade

**Anti-pattern:** Don't loop a 30-second music clip 3 times. The audience hears the loop seam immediately. Use proper trailer music with distinct sections (Two Steps From Hell, Audiomachine, Position Music, or custom).

## 6. Typography Rules for Trailers

Text in trailers must be read instantly under emotional duress. Clarity > creativity.

### On-Screen Duration Guidelines

| Text Type | Minimum On-Screen Time | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| Short title card (1–3 words) | 1.5 sec | 2–3 sec |
| Medium caption (4–8 words) | 2.0 sec | 3–4 sec |
| Long caption (1–2 sentences) | 3.0 sec | 4–5 sec |
| Game title reveal | 2.0 sec | 3–5 sec |
| End slate (full CTA) | 3.0 sec | 4–6 sec |
| ESRB rating (full screen) | Required 2.0 sec | 2 sec min |
| ESRB icon (15+ sec trailer) | Required 4.0 sec at start | per platform spec |

**Rule of thumb:** Read the text yourself as fast as you can, then add 1 second. That's your minimum.

### Font Size & Hierarchy

- **Title (game name):** Dominant — should be the largest text on screen. No competing elements.
- **Section headers / title cards:** 60–80% of title size. Must be instantly readable at a glance.
- **Body captions / plot text:** Legible but not competing with visuals. Bottom 1/3 of screen.
- **Legal lines / copyright:** Small but legible. Bottom edge, 100% opacity.
- **TikTok captions:** Large, high contrast, slightly playful. Top or bottom zone.

**Never use:** Light gray text on light backgrounds; italics-only for multi-word cards; fonts smaller than the equivalent of 36px at 1080p for title cards.

### Placement Rules

| Text Type | Recommended Position | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Game title reveal | Center screen | Maximum impact; full attention |
| Section title cards | Center screen over black | Clarity; visual rest |
| Gameplay captions | Lower 1/3 | Doesn't obscure action |
| CTA (Wishlist, etc.) | Center or center-lower | Must be the last thing seen |
| Annotation/supporting text | Left or right, upper area | Doesn't compete with action |
| ESRB icon | Bottom left or right | Per platform spec |

### Visual Style Rules

1. **Short is powerful** — "THEY SEALED HIM" beats "An ancient warrior was imprisoned by dark forces"
2. **Sentence case or ALL CAPS** for title cards — mixed case confuses parsing speed
3. **Limit to 2 font families max** — display font for titles + clean sans for captions
4. **High contrast always** — white text over dark background, or use a subtle text shadow / scrim
5. **Animation:** Simple fade or sharp cut-on. Avoid bouncy/playful text animations for hype trailers (they break tension)
6. **Match the game's visual language** — pixel font for pixel games; sharp gothic for dark fantasy; clean sans for tech/crypto
7. **Title cards over black** help divide sections and make them feel *fresh* — audiences feel they're getting something new each card

### TikTok-Specific Typography

- **Caption everything** — TikTok audiences expect it; it's how content reads on mute
- Large, punchy text in 9:16 zone
- Don't overlay captions on action-heavy frames; use upper or lower "dead zone"
- Auto-captioning tools: TikTok native, Captions app, Premiere Pro's speech-to-text

## 7. How to End a Trailer (Maximize Shares/Clicks)

The ending determines what viewers *do* next. A great trailer with a weak ending loses conversions.

### The Golden Rules

1. **Never end on black** — if the player pauses/it freezes, they see a black frame, not your CTA
2. **One CTA only** — multiple options = viewer chooses nothing
3. **End slate is NOT the ending** — the emotional climax should come BEFORE the end slate
4. **The last frame should be your game title + CTA**

### End Slate Hierarchy (Most → Least Prominent)

```
1. GAME TITLE (largest text on screen)
2. CALL TO ACTION ("WISHLIST ON STEAM" or "AVAILABLE NOW")
3. Release date or "Coming Soon"  
4. Platform logos (Switch, Steam, PS5, Xbox, mobile)
5. Developer / publisher logos (small, bottom-center)
6. Legal lines / copyright (smallest, bottom edge)
```

### CTA Priority by Stage

| Development Stage | Primary CTA | Secondary |
|---|---|---|
| Announce / Reveal | "Wishlist on Steam" | "Follow for updates" |
| Coming Soon | "Wishlist on Steam" | Release date window |
| Launch | "Available Now" + store links | "Buy Now" |
| Post-launch | "Play Now" | Review/community |

**Why Steam wishlists dominate:**
- Email notification on launch day = highest conversion rate of any channel
- Sale notifications keep you in front of lapsed viewers
- Social media posts announcing launch have comparatively tiny conversion %
- Discord/Twitter links on end slates dilute focus with minimal gain

### The "Button" Before the End Slate

One of the most powerful techniques: the **button** — a final 3–8 second moment placed just before the end slate that:
- Recontextualizes the whole trailer with a twist
- Delivers an emotional gut-punch
- Makes the audience laugh with unexpected humor
- Shows a mechanic/feature so wild viewers HAVE to share it

This is what generates the "omg did you see the trailer" shareability. Without a button, trailers end on a musical fade and get wishlisted (good). With a button, trailers get shared (great).

### The "Front-Load CTA" Technique

Since many viewers don't watch to the end, consider placing a **lite CTA bump** early:

```
[0–3 sec] COLD OPEN
[3–5 sec] Quick title bumper: "GAME TITLE — Available [date/platform]"
[5 sec+]  Continue with full trailer...
[end]     Full end slate
```

This ensures even viewers who bail at 20 seconds know the game name and where to find it.

### Making It Shareable

The factors that drive sharing (not just wishlisting):
- **Surprise mechanic reveal** — show the thing nobody else does
- **Emotional punch** — make viewers feel something before the CTA
- **Strong visual identity** — one frame that becomes the meme/screenshot
- **Sound design** — a satisfying sound effect or musical moment that's distinct
- **Clean ending** — a clear, satisfying resolution that feels complete (not a cliffhanger)
- **Community triggers** — visuals that make existing fans say "YES THAT"

## 8. Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Opening with studio logos | Viewers bail in first 3 sec; logos = corporate | Start with gameplay; put logos at end |
| Slow establishing shots | "I know this is pretty but what IS it?" | Hook first, establish second |
| Pacing too fast too early | No headroom for climax; feels exhausting | Start slow, build deliberately |
| Flat pacing throughout | Flatline loses attention; no contrast | Peaks AND valleys; use breath beats |
| Title cards off the beat | Feels sloppy; reduces impact | Lock title cards to musical downbeats |
| Overcutting for social trends | Loses clarity; feels like noise | Contrast > speed |
| Multiple CTAs at end | Viewer chooses nothing | One CTA only |
| Fading to black at the end | Last frame = black = wasted CTA | End on static CTA frame |
| Long pre-rolls of random logos | Screams "newbie studio trying to look AAA" | Remove unless your studio IS the brand |
| Showing WIP / unfinished footage | Sets expectations wrong; criticism incoming | Only show polished states |
| No captions on TikTok/social | Loses muted viewers | Caption everything on social |
| No voiceover (where appropriate) | Voice elevates perceived production quality | Even $100 VO can transform a trailer |

## 9. Ika Tensei Application Notes

Specific considerations for the Ika Tensei reveal/hype trailer given the game's positioning:

### Trailer Type & Primary Target

- **Type:** Announce/Reveal trailer (primary) + TikTok-native short content (secondary)
- **Primary platform:** YouTube (full narrative arc) + X/Twitter (clip-cut)  
- **Target length:** 60–90 seconds for YouTube; 15–25 sec for TikTok/social
- **Hook strategy:** Visual-first — the isekai/seal ritual is inherently dramatic

### Hook Ideas (Cold Open, 0–5 sec)

Options for pattern disruption:
1. **Flash of chain sealing** → sudden silence → game title fade in
2. **Character mid-combat** → freeze frame → "What would you sacrifice?"
3. **On-chain transaction animation** (abstract) → "Every soul has a price" 
4. **Rapid cuts** of the pixel art world → smash to black → sound of chains

### Structure Map for 75-sec Ika Tensei Trailer

```
0:00–0:05  → Cold Open (seal/isekai moment; no logos; atmosphere)
0:05–0:18  → Introduction (world/character; what is Ika Tensei; basic mechanic)
0:18–0:32  → Escalation Phase 1 (DeFi/on-chain mechanics; dWallet; trading system)  
0:32–0:46  → Escalation Phase 2 (Guild/DAO mechanics; multi-chain; cross-chain)
0:46–1:03  → Climax (fast montage; best visual moments; music peak; pixel art flex)
1:03–1:08  → Breath (single emotional/thematic frame; let it land)
1:08–1:12  → Button ("Your soul is on-chain now" or similar twist)
1:12–1:17  → End Slate (Title + "WISHLIST ON STEAM" / "JOIN THE PROTOCOL")
```

### Typography Identity

Ika Tensei should use:
- **Display font:** Pixel/retro game font for title (matches pixel art aesthetic)
- **Body/captions:** Clean, sharp sans-serif (readable under pixel art)
- **Section title cards:** ALL CAPS, pixel font, over deep black or dark purple/navy
- **CTA text:** Large, centered, high contrast (white or gold on black)

### Beat Sync Music Direction

- Music style: J-RPG-influenced with electronic/bass undertones (matches pixel art + DeFi hybrid)
- Key sync points: seal animation moments, chain transactions, character power-ups
- Climax beat drop: align with the most visually spectacular on-chain action sequence
- Silence weapon: use right before the "you've been isekai'd" reveal moment

### TikTok Content Strategy

Don't post the YouTube trailer to TikTok. Instead, create native TikTok content:
- "Here are all the animations for [specific mechanic]" clips
- "The first concept art vs. what it looks like now" comparison
- "How the on-chain soul-sealing actually works" explainer
- Behind-the-scenes: pixel art being made, smart contract deployment, etc.
