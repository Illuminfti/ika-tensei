## TECHNIQUE 1: Color Grading and Palette Shifts

### The Pattern
Great anime OPs don't have one color palette — they have **a palette journey** that mirrors emotional arc.

### Case Study: Jujutsu Kaisen OP1 "Kaikai Kitan"
- **0:00–0:15:** Cool desaturated purples and deep blacks → cursed energy feeling, dread
- **0:15–0:30:** EXPLOSION into electric magentas, acid yellows, neon cyan → power unleashed
- **0:30–0:45:** Soft, warm pastel flashback tones → humanity beneath the chaos
- **0:45–1:00:** Back to the cold purple-black with HOT white impact frames

**The technique:** Think of it as a chromatic narrative. Each section of the OP has a **dominant hue** that communicates the emotional state, then pivots hard on the beat drop.

### Case Study: Attack on Titan OP1 "Guren no Yumiya"
- Opens in **warm sepia** (the past, innocence, humanity)
- Cuts to **cold steel grays and military blues** (the Survey Corps reality)
- Climaxes in **blood reds + white** on the decisive action shots
- **Saturates** at the exact moment the walls break (color = emotion breaking out)

### Case Study: Chainsaw Man OP "KICK BACK"
- Mimics **film stock** color grading from classic cinema (sepia-toned for Texas Chainsaw Massacre reference)
- Each scene swap brings a new **film's color world** (Reservoir Dogs = cold blue desaturated street, Pulp Fiction = warm golden interior)
- The palette SHIFTS are as fast as cuts — you feel genre-hopping through color alone

### For Ika Tensei:
```
SECTION 1 (0-8s): Deep ocean blacks + bioluminescent cyan (Ika dormant / underworld)
SECTION 2 (8-20s): Explosive magenta/gold on character reveals (power awakening)  
SECTION 3 (20-30s): Crystal white + void black on final freeze frame (transcendence)

Color curve technique:
- Shadows: crush to pure black (no gray in shadows)
- Mids: slight green-teal shift for alien/supernatural
- Highlights: blow out to white on impact frames
- Saturation: +0% base → +80% burst on beat drops
```

---

## TECHNIQUE 2: Silhouette → Reveal Character Introduction

### The Pattern
Characters are introduced as **mystery before identity**. The silhouette says "something important is here" before the design pays it off.

### The 4-Stage Reveal Hierarchy
1. **Black silhouette on white/glowing background** — pure shape language
2. **Partial reveal** — hair + outline, face hidden (usually downward angle)
3. **Eye contact moment** — the look that locks you in (often a SLOW cut)
4. **Full power stance** — complete figure with color and detail

### Case Study: Attack on Titan
- Eren's silhouette appears **first as a titan shadow** before you see his human face → forces you to mentally connect the two
- Mikasa introduced as a **flowing scarf in darkness**, then the face in harsh light
- The scarf becomes a **visual motif** that repeats throughout every OP, becoming shorthand for "safety/love"

### Case Study: Demon Slayer
- Tanjiro introduced as silhouette walking toward camera through **fire and water simultaneously** — visual language saying "dual nature"
- Characters introduced from feet up (boots, legs, then face) during walking shots → movement-first reveals
- Female characters often introduced through **hair flowing** before face (elegance before power reveal)

### Case Study: Jujutsu Kaisen S2
- Gojo's reveal is specifically **delayed** compared to other characters — you see the blindfold first, the shape of power, before any face
- Geto's reveal is FROM BELOW, looking DOWN at the camera → power dynamic encoded in camera angle

### The Rule:
**The more powerful the character, the longer the reveal is delayed and the more unusual the camera angle.**

### For Ika Tensei:
```
Reveal sequence:
1. Ika as pure black silhouette against a glowing portal (0:03)
2. Tentacle tips — movement before identity (0:06)
3. Eyes only — gold on black (0:09)
4. Full form in explosion of light (0:15)
5. Final frame: direct eye contact with camera (0:28)

The "mask before face" rule: 
Show the NFT seal/badge floating in space BEFORE showing what it unlocks
```

---

## TECHNIQUE 3: Camera Movement Simulation

### The Core Moves (all achievable in 2D/motion graphics)

#### ZOOM (Push In)
- **Motivation:** Something important is getting closer to you
- **Speed:** Always start slow, accelerate through the subject
- **Technique:** Subject GROWS in frame while background blurs/darkens
- **Example:** AoT OP — camera pushes into the eye of a titan, which becomes a gate

#### DOLLY (Track Forward/Lateral)
- **Motivation:** You're moving THROUGH the world, not toward something
- **Speed:** Constant but can snap to a stop on beat
- **Technique:** Parallax layers move at different speeds (foreground fast, bg slow)
- **Example:** Chainsaw Man's Reservoir Dogs trucking shot — characters walk in slow dolly

#### PAN (Sweep)
- **Motivation:** Revealing scale or connecting two points in space
- **Speed:** Often fast pan with MOTION BLUR, then SNAPS to stillness
- **Example:** AoT reveals the wall → pans to reveal the titan HEAD above the wall

#### SHAKE (Impact/Chaos)
- **Motivation:** Something hit / explosion / power overwhelming
- **Technique:** 2-3 frame offset in random direction, HELD for 0.5-1 second
- **Frequency:** Use sparingly — max 2-3 times in a 30s sequence
- **Example:** Gurren Lagann's mecha impacts — shake on contact, freeze on pause

#### WHIP PAN / SMASH CUT
- **Motivation:** Speed, energy, urgency
- **Technique:** Full-frame motion blur between two STATIC shots
- **Rule:** The blur direction should be OPPOSITE to the next shot's implied movement

### Speed Control Matrix
```
SLOW (0.25x speed) → Use for: emotional weight, face reveals, power charging
NORMAL (1x) → Use for: establishing shots, character walks, world-building
FAST (2-4x) → Use for: action beats, montage overlays, skill flashes
FREEZE → Use for: climax punctuation, after biggest action beat
```

### Case Study: Attack on Titan OP1 — The Full Camera Language
```
0:00 - Static. Wall from below. Oppressive framing.
0:04 - Dolly up the wall face → scale horror
0:08 - Whip pan RIGHT → introduces Survey Corps running
0:12 - Zoom in on Eren's eye → zoom becomes TITAN eye transformation
0:16 - Fast horizontal pan, characters running → blur, speed, urgency
0:20 - Static low angle looking up at Mikasa → power
0:24 - Push in on fist → determination
0:28 - Wide. The battlefield. Freeze. Title.
```

### For Ika Tensei — Camera Script:
```
0:00-0:03: STATIC low angle. Ocean/portal. Silence.
0:03-0:06: SLOW PUSH IN toward the Ika silhouette
0:06-0:10: WHIP PAN — character montage, 3 fast cuts
0:10-0:15: DOLLY through the Ika world (parallax layers)
0:15-0:20: SMASH CUTS — fast 12-frame cuts on beat hits  
0:20-0:25: SLOW ZOOM on the seal NFT forming
0:25-0:28: FREEZE. White flash. Pull back WIDE.
0:28-0:30: Static. Title. Lingering.
```

---

## TECHNIQUE 4: Negative Space and Composition

### The Rule
**What you DON'T show is as powerful as what you do show.**

### The Golden Ratio of Anime OP Framing
- **60% negative space** on character introduction shots (character occupies only 40% of frame)
- **Rule of thirds** for power poses (character on left or right third, energy/environment in the other two thirds)
- **Central axis** placement ONLY for maximum importance moments (title reveal, final boss reveal)

### Case Study: Tokyo Ghoul "Unravel"
- Kaneki consistently placed in **extreme bottom-left** while the void/white fills the rest → isolation, smallness
- When his ghoul side takes over, he moves to **dead center** → dominance, fullness
- The mask appears in **negative space** before Kaneki does → the identity precedes the person

### Case Study: Jujutsu Kaisen
- Cursed spirits fill the **background void** as characters stand in foreground — always something lurking in negative space
- Gojo's signature pose: standing dead center, but the background is **pure white** → he IS the negative space (power as absence)
- Power/technique effects always EXPLODE OUTWARD from character → filling negative space with energy

### Case Study: Chainsaw Man
- Many shots **deliberately leave story room** — characters half-cropped at edge of frame, mid-action
- The surrealist shots use MAX negative space: one tiny figure in a massive landscape
- Power dynamics shown through SCALE: Makima always shown LARGER in frame relative to Denji (even standing next to each other)

### Negative Space Toolkit:
```
ISOLATION: Single character. Massive void. Communicates: alone, powerful, significant
OVERWHELM: Tiny character. Massive threat fills frame. Communicates: stakes, danger
BALANCE: 50/50 split between two forces. Communicates: conflict, duality
FILLED: Character surrounded by allies/energy. Communicates: belonging, peak power
```

### For Ika Tensei:
```
Shot 1 (Ika alone): Character bottom-center. Void black above. Glowing seal in top space.
Shot 2 (Character reveal): Character right-third. Network/web of connections in left two-thirds.
Shot 3 (Community): Multiple figures filling frame. No void. Belonging.
Shot 4 (Final): IKA TOKEN logo dead center. Perfectly centered. Maximum authority.
```

---

## TECHNIQUE 5: Speed Ramping — Slow → Fast → Freeze

### The Anatomy of an Anime OP Timing Curve

```
TIME:    |---0:00------|---0:08------|---0:16------|---0:24----|--0:30--|
SPEED:   [SLOW BUILD] → [ACCELERATE] → [PEAK FAST] → [RAMP DOWN] → [FREEZE]
MOOD:    [Intrigue]  →  [Energy]    →  [EPIC]      →  [Weight]   → [IMPACT]
```

### The 3-Speed Rule
Every great anime OP cycles through exactly **3 speed states** in each major section:
1. **SLOW** (0.3x–0.5x) — Establishes stakes, forces attention
2. **NORMAL → ACCELERATING** (1x → 2x) — Builds momentum
3. **FREEZE** (0x) — Punctuates. ALWAYS on beat hit.

### Case Study: Gurren Lagann "Sorairo Days"
- Opens on SLOW shots of Simon underground → melancholic, trapped
- As the music builds: accelerating cuts, the spiral drill emerging
- Beat drop: FREEZE on Kamina's dramatic pose → you READ the image
- Then: EXPLOSION of fast cuts, scale increasing from village → mecha → GALAXY SIZED MECHA
- Final frame: complete stillness. Simon looking at the stars.

The **emotional payoff** is entirely dependent on the contrast between the stillness and the explosion.

### Case Study: Attack on Titan Final Season
- Opens SLOW — boots on ground, faces, eyes. 2-3 second holds.
- Accelerates through the political shots, nation-scale imagery
- SMASH INTO fast-cut combat montage on the drum hits
- **Specific trick:** Each freeze frame is held for exactly ONE BEAT of the music, then the next cut lands on the DOWNBEAT

### The Freeze Frame Rules:
```
1. Always hit on the LOUDEST part of the beat (kick drum or bass hit)
2. Hold for minimum 12 frames (0.5 seconds at 24fps) — any shorter feels like a cut
3. The frozen image must have MAXIMUM compositional clarity (no motion blur)
4. What follows a freeze must be the FASTEST cut in the sequence
5. You only get 2-3 freezes per 30 seconds — use them on the 3 MOST IMPORTANT images
```

### Speed Ramp Curve for Ika Tensei (30-second build):
```
0:00-0:04: 0.3x speed. Single image. Atmospheric.
0:04-0:08: 0.7x speed. Slow establish. World-building.
0:08-0:12: 1x→1.5x. Momentum building. Character reveal begins.
0:12-0:18: 2x-3x. Rapid cuts. 8 cuts in 6 seconds. Power montage.
0:18-0:22: FREEZE #1. Major character reveal. 1 beat held.
0:22-0:26: 4x FASTEST. Final push. Everything.
0:26-0:28: FREEZE #2. The payoff image. 2 beats held.
0:28-0:30: 0.2x SLOW. Title fades in. Done.
```

## TECHNIQUE 6: Symbolic Imagery and Recurring Visual Motifs

### The Law of the Motif
Every iconic OP has **one core visual motif** that appears in multiple forms throughout. By the end of the OP, seeing just a fragment of that motif triggers the emotional response.

### Case Study: Attack on Titan — The Wall
The **vertical wall** motif appears as:
- The literal walls of Paradis
- The typography — the OP credits are embedded IN walls, carved like stone
- Characters running UP vertical surfaces (walls, titans)
- The "looking up" camera angle (humans always below, threats above)
- Final shot: scale of wall vs humans reinforces the thesis of the entire show

### Case Study: Chainsaw Man — The Dog/Contract
Director Shingo Yamashita embedded **Denji's submissive relationship with Makima** as a visual motif:
- Makima's foot tapping → shot mimics Pulp Fiction's opening shot of Uma Thurman's feet (power coded through body language)
- Denji literally on a leash in early shots
- The chainsaw cord as both weapon AND collar/tether
- Every surrealist scene is reachable via the CONTRACT metaphor — Denji's soul belongs to something larger

### Case Study: Jujutsu Kaisen — Eyes
- Every character introduction includes an **extreme close-up on the eyes**
- Cursed energy manifests AS pupil distortion (Gojo's six eyes, curse marks spreading across sclera)
- The OP climaxes on eye contact with camera → YOU are in the jujutsu world
- Eyes = power gauge AND character soul window throughout all JJK OPs

### Case Study: Gurren Lagann — The Spiral
- The spiral appears as: the drill, the galaxy shape, Simon's path of growth, camera rotations
- It's a literal cosmological constant in the show's mythology
- The OP uses ROTATIONAL camera moves to echo the spiral
- Even the title logo has spiral letterforms
- This unifies every element: "everything spirals upward"

### The Motif Design Pattern:
```
1. Choose ONE abstract concept that represents the show's core theme
2. Find 5-7 physical forms that shape can take
3. Make sure the motif appears at LEAST once in each section of the OP
4. The final appearance should be the largest/most explicit
5. First appearance should be subtle (plant the seed)
```

### For Ika Tensei — Motif Candidates:
```
PRIMARY MOTIF: The SEAL / CIRCLE
- Appears as: NFT seal spinning, summoning circle, portal/vortex, Ika's eye (circular iris)
- Camera moves that are CIRCULAR (barrel rolls, orbit shots)
- Typography that has circular letterforms
- Character reveals emerging FROM circles (portals, stamps, spell circles)

SECONDARY MOTIF: INK / TENTACLE
- Appears as: Ink spreading across water, tentacle tendrils = network connections
- The blockchain as neural web (visually echoes tentacle spread)
- Liquid transitions between scenes (ink wipe, water dissolve)
- Ika's movement = ink flow (fluid, spreading, organic)
```

## TECHNIQUE 7: Making 30 Seconds Feel EPIC

### The Architecture of Epic

Epic isn't about VOLUME — it's about **contrast**. The quiet makes the loud louder.

### The 4-Act Structure (within 30 seconds)

```
ACT I — THE HOOK (0-6 seconds)
  - STATEMENT: One powerful image. Hold it.
  - PURPOSE: "What is this? I need to know more."
  - Techniques: Negative space, mysterious silhouette, atmospheric sound design
  - Feeling: Intrigue, questions

ACT II — THE BUILD (6-18 seconds)  
  - EXPANSION: World opens. Characters revealed.
  - PURPOSE: "This is bigger than I thought."
  - Techniques: Accelerating cuts, palette expansion, scale reveals
  - Feeling: Anticipation, mounting excitement

ACT III — THE CLIMAX (18-26 seconds)
  - PAYOFF: The thing you've been waiting for
  - PURPOSE: "YES. THERE IT IS."
  - Techniques: Maximum speed → sudden FREEZE, biggest color saturation, widest shot
  - Feeling: Catharsis, awe

ACT IV — THE PUNCTUATION (26-30 seconds)
  - ECHO: Slow fade. Title. Let it breathe.
  - PURPOSE: "I want to feel this again."
  - Techniques: Return to stillness, motif echo, held frame
  - Feeling: Resonance, wanting to rewatch
```

### The Contrast Engineering Table:

| What came before | What comes next | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Fast cuts (12 per second) | Freeze frame (2 seconds) | MAXIMUM IMPACT |
| Tiny character, vast void | Character fills whole frame | Power surge |
| Desaturated, cold palette | Explosion of warm red/gold | Emotional breakthrough |
| Silence / atmospheric | Full orchestral hit | Adrenaline spike |
| Many characters, chaos | ONE character, stillness | Focused authority |
| Close up on detail | Wide establishing shot | Scale awe |
| Dark background | Pure white flash | Blinding arrival |

### The "1-2-3 Punch" Pattern
Every great anime OP uses this 3-beat structure at the climax:
```
1. FAST FAST FAST cuts (build tension)
2. SILENCE / FREEZE (tension peaks, nowhere to go)
3. EXPLOSION into final image (release)

Example — AoT OP1 climax:
1. Rapid cuts of soldiers dying, titans overwhelming → 8 cuts in 3 seconds
2. FREEZE on Eren's face, jaw set, eyes burning → 1.5 second hold
3. CUT TO: Scouts charging with ODM gear, full orchestral SWELL → release
```

### Pacing Hacks That Feel Bigger Than Budget:
```
1. FLASH FRAME: A single white or black frame (1-2 frames) before a cut. 
   Makes cuts feel more impactful without any additional animation.

2. CHROMATIC ABERRATION: RGB split on high-motion frames only (not everywhere).
   3px offset on R/B channels. Feels like reality tearing.

3. VIGNETTE PULSE: Vignette gets DARKER before big reveals, then SNAPS to bright.
   Like pupil dilation. Subconscious intensity.

4. SHAKE ON DOWNBEAT: 3-frame random offset on the camera, synced to kick drum.
   Not a smooth shake — ABRUPT. That's the difference.

5. SPEED LINE OVERLAY: During fast cuts, add radial speed lines at 40% opacity.
   Classic anime trick — adds velocity without animation cost.

6. THE 12-FRAME RULE: Cut on EVERY beat that's 12 frames apart = 2 cuts/second.
   Any faster and human eye loses tracking. Any slower and momentum drops.
   Find the song's BPM, calculate 12-frame grid, cut to it.
```

## CHAINSAW MAN OP — DEEP DIVE (Reference Masterclass)

**Director:** Shingo Yamashita
**Song:** "KICK BACK" by Kenshi Yonezu
**Runtime:** 1:29 (but first 30s is a complete standalone experience)

### Why It's a Masterclass

#### Layer 1: Film Grammar as Character Voice
Every scene mimics a specific FILM, turning the OP into a **cinematic love letter**:
- Denji on stone monument = Texas Chainsaw Massacre → establishes horror lineage
- Makima's foot tapping at table = Pulp Fiction (Uma Thurman's feet) → power/danger coded through body language
- Kishibe with gun at table = Jules Winnfield scene, Pulp Fiction → authority
- Group walking down street = Reservoir Dogs opening trucking shot → gang, power in numbers
- Aki driving = Once Upon a Time in Hollywood → character study, melancholy
- Angel Devil descending = Constantine → supernatural
- Dance sequence = Bande à Part → joy, freedom (a CONTRAST moment — rare lightness)

**The insight:** Each film reference isn't decorative — it TELLS YOU about the character shown. Yamashita lets 70 years of cinema do his characterization work.

#### Layer 2: Symbolic Logic
```
Denji pulling chainsaw cord = Dante pulling at the leash of Alichino (Divine Comedy)
  → Denji IS in hell. The cord is his binding AND his weapon.

Makima's feet → power shown through what she DOESN'T have to do
  → She never needs to show effort. That's what makes her terrifying.

The split tongue imagery = demon hybrid
  → Denji is of two worlds, his identity is severed

Characters watching themselves in a movie theater = meta-awareness
  → They KNOW they're in a story. This OP knows you're watching.
```

#### Layer 3: Visual Speed Engineering
The OP uses EXACTLY 3 tempos:
1. **Long slow takes** for the film homage scenes (establishing the reference)
2. **Fast intercutting** during the chorus (energy burst)
3. **TOTAL STILLNESS** on the most surreal/symbolic frames (force you to process)

The stillness is what makes the fast cuts land. You can't have one without the other.

---

## ATTACK ON TITAN OP — DEEP DIVE (Typography as Architecture)

### What Makes AoT's Typography Revolutionary

The credits and title text in AoT OPs are **carved into the world's surfaces**:
- Names appear as if chiseled into stone walls
- Text has texture matching the environment (rough stone = carved deep, metal surfaces = stamped)
- The font is Germanic/blackletter → historical weight, oppression, formality
- Text DOES NOT float over images — it IS PART OF the image

### The Typography Technique:
```
1. Text appears as environmental element (matched to surface)
2. Camera can move THROUGH text (dolly past carved letters)
3. Text reveals progressively (left-to-right chisel effect) 
4. Scale: some text is MASSIVE relative to character (titan-scale inscriptions)
5. Color: text matches environment tone ≠ contrasted over it
```

### The Scale Journey (AoT OP Structure)
```
Shot 1: CLOSE. A single eye. Human scale.
Shot 5: MEDIUM. A character in a corridor. Room scale.
Shot 10: WIDE. A soldier on a rooftop. City scale.
Shot 15: WIDER. Soldiers on a wall. Wall scale.
Shot 20: WIDEST. Wall vs titan. Titan scale.
Shot 25: ESTABLISHING. War across the plain. Battlefield scale.
```

**The rule:** Each major section of the OP opens the frame by ONE scale level. You physically feel the world getting bigger and more dangerous.

---

## JUJUTSU KAISEN OP — DEEP DIVE (Color as Cursed Energy)

### S1 OP1 "Kaikai Kitan" — The Psychedelic System

The color shifts in JJK S1 OP are NOT random — they encode CURSED ENERGY LEVELS:

```
COLOR CODING:
- Purple-black = latent/dormant cursed energy (potential, waiting)
- Deep blue = trained/controlled jujutsu (Gojo, precision)
- Magenta/pink = uncontrolled cursed energy (danger, emotion overwhelming technique)
- Gold/yellow = Domain Expansion activation (absolute power mode)
- White/blinding = Six Eyes / Limitless (Gojo's true power, beyond color)
```

The palette shifts between character shots ENCODE THE POWER DYNAMIC. You FEEL who's more powerful through color alone before any action happens.

### The Cursed Energy Visual Grammar:
```
1. Cursed energy builds: dark→saturated→bright (charging animation)
2. Technique activation: color INVERTS briefly (white on black becomes black on white)
3. Impact: chromatic aberration (RGB split) + color FLUSH to single hue
4. Domain Expansion: the entire palette shifts to the technique's signature color
   - Gojo's Infinity = gradient white sphere
   - Sukuna's Malevolent Shrine = deep reds and cathedral purples
```

### S2 OP "Where Our Blue Is" — Contrast as Tragedy

**The genius:** The S2 OP is WARM and BEAUTIFUL — blues, warm oranges, youth, friendship.

You know this will be destroyed. The palette choice IS the tragedy. The audience knows what's coming. Making the OP beautiful makes the tragedy unbearable.

**Technique:** Use WRONG palette for emotional contrast. Show beauty before destruction. The mismatch creates dread.

## ACTIONABLE TAKEAWAYS FOR IKA TENSEI TRAILER

### The Trailer Blueprint (30 seconds)

```
SECONDS 0-6: "THE VOID" (Intrigue phase)
  - Visual: Black. Slowly, glowing circular seal forms from nothing
  - Color: Deep blacks, single point of cyan/gold
  - Speed: 0.3x. Near stillness.
  - Audio: Silence → distant, deep drone
  - Goal: Create questions. "What is this?"

SECONDS 6-15: "THE WORLD OPENS" (Build phase)
  - Visual: Ika silhouette → reveal. World glimpses. Other characters.
  - Color: Gradual palette expansion. Blacks → deep blues → hints of gold
  - Speed: Accelerating from 0.7x → 1.5x. Cut rhythm tightens.
  - Camera: Slow push in on Ika → whip pan to world → dolly through
  - Goal: Establish scale and stakes

SECONDS 15-24: "THE POWER" (Climax phase)
  - Visual: FAST CUTS. Every faction, every power, every character.
  - Color: MAXIMUM saturation. Magentas, electric blues, burning golds.
  - Speed: 3-4x. 12 cuts in 8 seconds.  
  - FREEZE at 0:22 on the NFT seal / Ika full reveal
  - Camera: Shake on beat hits
  - Goal: CATHARSIS. "YES."

SECONDS 24-30: "THE PUNCTUATION" (Echo phase)
  - Visual: Wide shot. Ika in the center. Universe around it. Title.
  - Color: Return to cool blacks, but the seal GLOWS warm
  - Speed: 0.2x. Near stillness. Mirror of the opening.
  - Camera: STATIC. Let it breathe.
  - Goal: Burn the image into memory. Make them want to rewatch.
```

### The Motif Implementation:
```
PRIMARY: CIRCLE/SEAL (appears 6+ times)
  - 0:02: Seal forming from nothing (planted, subtle)
  - 0:08: Ika's eye (echo)
  - 0:12: Portal characters emerge from
  - 0:18: Spinning summoning circle in battle
  - 0:22: FREEZE on seal (central reveal)
  - 0:27: Logo circle in title (final, explicit)

SECONDARY: INK/FLUID MOTION
  - Transitions: ink wipe between scenes (ink = Ika, connections)
  - Ika's power effects: ink-spreading visual metaphor
  - The blockchain visualized as ink web spreading across dark void
```

### Color Script for Implementation:
```
Frame 0:    rgb(5, 5, 15)         — near pure black, slight blue
Frame 180:  rgb(0, 40, 80)        — deep ocean blue
Frame 360:  rgb(20, 60, 120)      — building
Frame 540:  rgb(255, 200, 50)     — GOLD BURST (character reveal)
Frame 648:  rgb(180, 0, 255)      — magenta power
Frame 720:  rgb(255, 255, 255)    — WHITE FREEZE FRAME
Frame 756:  rgb(10, 10, 30)       — back to near black
Frame 840:  rgb(15, 15, 30)       — title on void, seal glows
```

### Typography Rules (AoT-inspired):
```
1. Title text should feel WEIGHT — heavy, not floating
2. Embed text in the visual environment (part of the world, not over it)
3. Use single typeface. One weight. Maximum authority.
4. Text reveals on a LINE BY LINE or WORD BY WORD basis, synced to beat
5. Final title appearance: HOLD for minimum 2 seconds. Don't rush it.
```

### The 5 Non-Negotiables for "Feels Like an Anime OP":
```
1. ONE visual motif that appears minimum 5 times
2. THREE distinct color phases (cool → hot → cool)
3. SPEED RAMP from near-stillness to maximum speed and back
4. MINIMUM 2 freeze frames, maximum 3 (on beat hits only)
5. Character reveal using silhouette → partial → full (minimum for protagonist)
```
